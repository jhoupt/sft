}
\description{
Performs either an Adjusted Rank Transform or ANOVA test for an interaction at the mean level.

\usage{
mic.test(HH, HL, LH, LL, method=c("art", "anova"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{HH}{Response times from the High--High condition.}
  \item{HL}{Response times from the High--Low condition.}
  \item{LH}{Response times from the Low--High condition.}
  \item{LL}{Response times from the Low--Low condition.}
  \item{method}{If "art", use the adjusted rank transform test.  If "anova" use ANOVA.}

\details{
  The mean interaction contrast (MIC) indicates the architecture of a process.  Serial processes result in MIC equal to zero.  Parallel-OR and Coactive process have a positive MIC.  Parallel-AND process have a negative MIC.  A test for a significant MIC can be done with a nonparametric adjusted rank transform test (described below) or an ANOVA.

  The Adjusted Rank Transform is a nonparametric test for an interaction between two discrete variables.  The test is carried out by first subtracting the mean effect of the salience level on each channel.  Suppose, 
\eqn{m_{H,\cdot} =} E[RT; Level of Channel 1 is Fast],
\eqn{m_{L,\cdot} =} E[RT; Level of Channel 1 is Slow],
\eqn{m_{\cdot, H} =} E[RT; Level of Channel 2 is Fast],
\eqn{m_{\cdot, L} =} E[RT; Level of Channel 2 is Slow].
Then for each response time from the fast--fast condition, \eqn{m_{H, \cdot}} and \eqn{m_{\cdot,H}} are subtracted.  Likewise, for each of the other conditions, the appropriate \eqn{m} is subtracted.  Next, each mean subtracted response time is replaced with its rank across all conditions (e.g., the fastest time of all conditions would be replaced with a 1).  In this implementation, tied response times are assigned using the average rank.  Finally, a standard ANOVA on the ranks is done on the ranks and the \eqn{p}-value of that test is returned.  This test was recommended by Sawilowsky (1990) based on a survey of a number of nonparametric tests for interactions.  He credits Reinach (1965) for first developing the test.
